## Overview

Nudge Lab is a behavioral science platform built to help product teams design, test, and analyze behavioral nudges. Drawing on principles from behavioral economics and psychology, it provides a toolkit for crafting interventions that drive meaningful, measurable user behavior change.

## Key Features

- **Nudge Designer**: An intuitive interface for composing and previewing behavioral interventions before deployment.
- **Experiment Runner**: A/B testing infrastructure built into the platform so teams can validate nudge effectiveness with real data.
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Dashboards that surface engagement metrics, conversion lifts, and long-term behavior trends.
- **Pattern Library**: A curated collection of proven nudge patterns—defaults, social proof, loss aversion, and more—with implementation guidance.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js & React**: For a fast, server-rendered frontend with a smooth user experience.
- **TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety across the stack.
- **Vercel**: Deployment and edge functions for low-latency delivery worldwide.
